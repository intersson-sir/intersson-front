        "param1Desc": "No, not always. If you choose to integrate ready-made solutions via API, your own data is not required. For additional training of pre-existing models or development from scratch, data is preferred, but we can help collect and prepare datasets if you don’t have them.",
        "param2Title": "How long does it take to implement a neural network solution?",
        "param2Desc": "It all depends on the chosen approach. API integration can yield results within one to two weeks. Fine-tuning a pre-trained model takes from a few weeks to six months, depending on task complexity and data volume. Developing a model from scratch may take six months or longer.",
        "param3Title": "What accuracy guarantees can you provide?",
        "param3Desc": "We focus on metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, Recall, etc., which we agree upon during the technical specification stage. The more extensive and high-quality your dataset, the higher the potential accuracy. When integrating pre-trained API solutions, accuracy depends on the provider, but in most cases, they already offer high-performance models.",
        "param4Title": "How can we scale the ready-made solution?",
        "param4Desc": "We use modern MLOps tools and cloud technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Azure), which allow easy scaling as demand increases. For API-based integration, scalability is usually handled by the provider.",
        "param5Title": "How much does it cost and what does the price depend on?",
        "param5Desc": "The cost is calculated based on project complexity, required time, and data volume. API integration is the most cost-effective option as it does not require significant computing resources. Fine-tuning pre-trained models is more expensive but still saves time compared to creating a model from scratch. Full custom development is the most resource-intensive approach, but it offers the highest flexibility and control over the final outcome."

        "param1Desc": "Typically, it takes anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months for a standard project (e.g., ERC-20 on Ethereum). The timeline depends on the complexity of the logic (additional features, roles, emission mechanics) and whether an audit is required.",
        "param2Title": "Is a smart contract audit necessary, and who handles it?",
        "param2Desc": "Yes, an audit is highly recommended. It helps identify and fix critical vulnerabilities before deployment.",
        "param3Title": "How do I decide whether to build my own blockchain or launch a token on an existing network?",
        "param3Desc": "If you need full control over the protocol (consensus level, fees, specific logic), then developing your own blockchain makes sense. However, if you want a faster, lower-budget launch and access to a broad ecosystem (wallets, exchanges), using an existing network (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon) is often the best choice.",
        "param4Title": "Will my token automatically be listed on exchanges (DEX/CEX)?",
        "param4Desc": "Not automatically. On decentralized exchanges (DEX), you can add a liquidity pool yourself (e.g., on Uniswap or PancakeSwap). For centralized exchanges (CEX), listing requires an application process where the exchange evaluates your project before approval. We can assist with the technical aspects (development, documentation), but the final listing decision rests with the exchange."

        "param1Desc": "The timeline depends on the scale: you can start small, such as automating document flow in a few weeks. However, full-scale transformation can take months or even years. The first step should always be an audit of current processes and setting clear goals.",
        "param2Title": "Should we change all processes at once or implement solutions gradually?",
        "param2Desc": "A phased approach is usually more effective: first, digitalize the most problematic or resource-intensive areas, then expand to other departments and processes. This approach delivers quick results and allows the team to adapt to new tools more easily.",
        "param3Title": "What are the main benefits of digital transformation for a company?",
        "param3Desc": "Resource savings, reduction of manual errors, increased transparency and process speed, and improved customer service. Ultimately, the company becomes more competitive, responding faster to market changes and customer needs.",
        "param4Title": "How do we deal with employee resistance to new technologies?",
        "param4Desc": "It is crucial to engage employees from the beginning: explain the value of changes, allow them to provide input, and conduct training sessions. When employees see that new tools simplify their work, resistance decreases, and the overall team morale improves.",
        "param5Title": "How do we determine whether the implemented solutions are effective?",
        "param5Desc": "Key performance indicators (KPIs) should be established—such as request processing time, cost per document, and customer satisfaction. Using analytics systems (BI dashboards, CRM/ERP reports), you can track these metrics over time. If they improve, the digital transformation is on the right track."

        "param1Title": "How long does a technical audit take, and what affects the timeline?",
        "param1Desc": "The timeframe depends on the scope: the larger the infrastructure and the deeper the assessment (security, performance, architecture), the more time is required. On average, an express audit takes 1–2 weeks, while a full corporate architecture audit may take six months or more.",
        "param2Title": "Why do we need a security audit if we don't have public-facing services?",
        "param2Desc": "Even if your services are not public, internal vulnerabilities can lead to data leaks or system failures. An audit helps identify weak spots in configurations, passwords, access roles, and protects against insider threats or accidental errors.",
